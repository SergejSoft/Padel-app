## 🥎 American Format Padel Tournament Rules

### What is an American Format Tournament in Padel?

An American Format Padel Tournament is a **fun, social, and competitive** way to play padel where players rotate partners and compete against different pairs. Each match awards **points to the pair**, and at the end of the tournament, each player’s points are summed up to determine their overall standing.

## 📝 8-Player American Format Tournament

✅ **Number of Players:** 8
✅ **Number of Courts:** 2

* Players rotate partners and opponents each round so that everyone partners with every other player at least once.
* Each match is **short**, typically lasting **16 points total** rather than a full set.
* After each match, players record the points won by their **pair**.
* At the end of the tournament, each player’s **individual total score** is the sum of all the points they’ve won as part of each pair.
* The player with the highest individual score is declared the **tournament winner**.

## 📝 12-Player American Format Tournament

✅ **Number of Players:** 12
✅ **Number of Courts:** 3

* Same format as above, but with 3 courts playing simultaneously.
* Each player partners with everyone at least once.
* Matches last **16 points total** per match.
* Each player’s total points are tallied at the end.

## 🎾 How Points are Counted

* Each match consists of **16 points total**.
* Each player serves **4 points** (4 rallies) in rotation.
* Points are awarded **to the pair** that wins each rally.
* At the end of the match, each player on the winning pair is credited with the **total number of points won by their team**.
* Example:

  * If Team A wins all 16 points, each player on Team A earns **16 points**, while each player on Team B earns **0 points**.

## 🔄 How to Switch Sides

* To keep play fair and balanced, players **switch sides after 8 points** have been played (halfway through the 16-point match).
* This rotation helps balance factors like sun glare, wind, or court surface conditions.
* When the 8th point is completed, all players rotate sides **clockwise**.
* The serve order continues as normal after switching sides.

Example Sequence:
1️⃣ Player A serves 4 points
2️⃣ Player B serves 4 points
➡️ After point 8, all players switch sides clockwise
3️⃣ Player C serves 4 points
4️⃣ Player D serves 4 points

* After the 16th point is played, the match is over, and players rotate partners and opponents for the next round.
